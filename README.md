Use string_gen.pl to generate string halves, then mirror them or use the provided parser_input.txt

Run new_part_placer.py with parser_input.txt in the same directory.

Unfortunately without the SWRI pipeline from the DARPA UAV challenge and a working copy of CREO this will only generate descriptions of vehicles.

Samples of full pipeline outputs as well as an in depth explanation of goals and findings may be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10424628
